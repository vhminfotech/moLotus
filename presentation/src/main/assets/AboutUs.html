<h2 style="color:#27a9e1" align="center"> Novosol Story </h2>
<p>The key ideas and technology behind Novosol were conceived back in the early 2000â€™s when our CEO
    was architecting and implementing large turnkey projects at Asian and Latin American telcos.
    These include the first 3G networks and mobile content solutions. It was clear that mobile
    everything was the future, and video and interaction were the keys. Fast Forward 10 years, and
    Novosol is born. Having received a Series A funding, Novosol is investing in enhancing mobile
    video, creating new formats and build a globally scalable video messaging platform. On the
    business end, we have been busy winning marquee clients, innovating new marketing and business
    use cases. Now, with direct sales and global partnerships in the SEA markets, we are ready to
    expand our platform and revenue.</p>

    to transform not only the customer/consumer communications but also brand/merchant operations
